# 77 Assignment: Create A Multi-Service Multi-Node Web App

- Using Docker's Distributed Voting App
- use `swarm-app-1` directory in our course repo for requirements
- 1 volume, 2 networks, and 5 services needed
- create the commands needed, spin up services, and test app
- Everything is using Docker Hub images, so no data needed on Swarm
- Like many computer things, this is 1/2 art form and 1/2 science
